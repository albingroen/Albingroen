Hey, I'm Albin! I'm a self taught fullstack developer focused on React and Typescript. I currently work at [Dooer](https://dooer.com), which is the second company I've worked at. I started out at a startup called [Wopify](https://wopify.com) where I got to take on a lot of responsibility early on and learned a whole lot.

On my spare time I like to try out new technologies, attend meetups, speak at conferences and meet new people. I also enjoy working out, playing sports and haning out with my friends.

Down below you can find some of my many sideprojects.
